# Undo/Redo Implementation for Setup Battle Scene

## Overview

I have successfully implemented undo/redo functionality for the SetupBattleScene using the Command Pattern. This allows users to use **Ctrl+Z** for undo and **Ctrl+Shift+Z** for redo operations while setting up battles.

## Key Features

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Ctrl+Z**: Undo the last action
- **Ctrl+Shift+Z**: Redo the last undone action

### Undoable Operations
1. **Placing Units**: When a unit is placed on the battlefield from the barracks, it can be undone
2. **Removing Units**: When a unit is removed from the battlefield (right-click), it can be undone
3. **Moving Units**: When a unit is moved from one position to another (left-click pickup + left-click place), the entire move is treated as a single undoable operation

## Technical Implementation

### Command Pattern Architecture

The implementation uses the Command Pattern with the following classes:

#### Base Command Class
```python
class Command(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self) -> None:
        """Execute the command."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def undo(self) -> None:
        """Undo the command."""
        pass
```

#### PlaceUnitCommand
- **Purpose**: Handles placing new units from the barracks onto the battlefield
- **Execute**: Creates a unit entity, updates battle data, and updates UI state
- **Undo**: Removes the unit entity, removes from battle data, and restores barracks count
- **Key Improvement**: Directly tracks the entity ID returned by `create_unit()` for reliable removal

#### RemoveUnitCommand
- **Purpose**: Handles removing units from the battlefield (right-click deletion)
- **Execute**: Removes unit entity and updates UI state
- **Undo**: Re-creates the unit at its original position with original properties

#### MoveUnitCommand
- **Purpose**: Handles moving a unit from one position to another (left-click pickup + left-click place)
- **Execute**: Updates the unit's position and battle data without deleting/recreating the entity
- **Undo**: Moves the unit back to its original position and updates battle data
- **Key Feature**: Treats the entire move as a single operation, so undoing restores the unit to its original position

### State Management

#### Undo/Redo Stacks
The SetupBattleScene maintains two stacks:
- `undo_stack`: Stores executed commands that can be undone
- `redo_stack`: Stores undone commands that can be redone

#### Stack Behavior
- When a new command is executed, it's added to the undo stack and the redo stack is cleared
- When undoing, commands are moved from undo stack to redo stack
- When redoing, commands are moved from redo stack back to undo stack

#### Move State Tracking
The scene tracks when a unit is being moved vs when placing a new unit:
- `moving_unit`: Stores `(unit_id, original_position, team)` when a unit is picked up for moving
- This distinguishes between placing new units from barracks vs moving existing units
- State is cleared when the move completes, is cancelled, or when selecting from barracks

### User Interaction Flow

#### Moving a Unit
1. **Left-click on unit**: Unit is "picked up" - stores original position but doesn't remove from battlefield yet
2. **Left-click to place**: Executes `MoveUnitCommand` with original and new positions
3. **Right-click to cancel**: Cancels the move, unit stays at original position

#### Placing New Unit
1. **Click barracks unit**: Selects unit type for placement (clears any pending move)
2. **Left-click to place**: Executes `PlaceUnitCommand` to create new unit

#### Removing Unit
1. **Right-click on unit**: Executes `RemoveUnitCommand` to delete unit

### Integration Points

#### Modified Methods
1. **`create_unit_of_selected_type()`**: Now creates and executes a `PlaceUnitCommand`
2. **`remove_unit()`**: Now creates and executes a `RemoveUnitCommand`
3. **`update()`**: Added undo/redo keyboard event handling and updated mouse logic
4. **`set_selected_unit_type()`**: Clears moving unit state when selection is cleared
5. **Mouse click handlers**: Completely rewritten to distinguish between moves and new placements

#### Event Handling
The `handle_undo_redo_keys()` method:
- Detects Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Shift+Z key combinations
- Calls appropriate undo/redo methods
- Returns True if the event was handled to prevent further processing

## Data Integrity

### Complete State Restoration
Each command preserves and restores:
- **Unit Entity**: Complete unit with all components and properties
- **Battle Data**: Updates to `battle.allies` and `battle.enemies` lists
- **UI State**: Barracks unit counts and progress panel updates
- **Audio Feedback**: Appropriate sound effects for placement/removal/movement

### Coordinate System Handling
- Properly handles world coordinates vs. local battle coordinates
- Uses `axial_to_world()` for coordinate transformations
- Maintains consistency with existing placement logic

### Move Operation Benefits
- **Atomic**: Moving a unit is a single operation that can be undone with one Ctrl+Z
- **Efficient**: Doesn't delete and recreate entities, just updates position
- **Consistent**: Maintains unit entity ID and all components throughout the move

## User Experience

### Seamless Integration
- Works with existing mouse placement/removal interactions
- Maintains all existing functionality (grid snapping, team restrictions, etc.)
- Provides immediate feedback through sound effects
- No visual changes to the UI - purely keyboard-driven

### Improved Move Handling
- **Before**: Moving a unit required two undos (undo placement, undo removal)
- **After**: Moving a unit requires only one undo (restores to original position)
- **Cancellation**: Right-click during move cancels without creating undo entries
- **State Management**: Selecting from barracks automatically cancels any pending move

### Edge Cases Handled
- Undo/redo when no actions are available (no-op)
- Proper clearing of redo stack when new actions are performed
- Maintains unit selection state appropriately
- Handles both sandbox and normal campaign modes
- Move cancellation doesn't pollute undo history
- Barracks selection clears move state

## Code Quality

### Architecture Benefits
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new undoable operations
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns with command classes
- **Testable**: Each command can be tested independently
- **Consistent**: Follows existing codebase patterns and style
- **Type Safe**: Proper typing for all state variables

### Performance Considerations
- Minimal memory overhead (only stores command metadata)
- Efficient entity ID tracking eliminates search operations
- Move operations don't delete/recreate entities
- Commands execute quickly without noticeable delay

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions that could be implemented using the same pattern:
- Undoable unit selection changes
- Undoable corruption power modifications
- Batch operations (e.g., "undo all placements", "move multiple units")
- Undo history persistence across sessions
- Multi-step move operations (pick up multiple units)

## Files Modified

- `src/scenes/setup_battle.py`: Main implementation with Command classes and undo/redo system
- `undo_redo_implementation.md`: This documentation file

The implementation is complete and ready for use!
