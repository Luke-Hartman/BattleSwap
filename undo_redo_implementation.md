# Undo/Redo Implementation for Setup Battle Scene

## Overview

I have successfully implemented undo/redo functionality for the SetupBattleScene using the Command Pattern. This allows users to use **Ctrl+Z** for undo and **Ctrl+Shift+Z** for redo operations while setting up battles.

## Key Features

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Ctrl+Z**: Undo the last action
- **Ctrl+Shift+Z**: Redo the last undone action

### Undoable Operations
1. **Placing Units**: When a unit is placed on the battlefield from the barracks, it can be undone
2. **Removing Units**: When a unit is removed from the battlefield (right-click), it can be undone
3. **Moving Units**: When a unit is moved from one position to another (left-click pickup + left-click place), the entire move is treated as a single undoable operation

## Technical Implementation

### Command Pattern Architecture

The implementation uses the Command Pattern with the following classes:

#### Base Command Class
```python
class Command(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self) -> None:
        """Execute the command."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def undo(self) -> None:
        """Undo the command."""
        pass
```

#### PlaceUnitCommand
- **Purpose**: Handles placing new units from the barracks onto the battlefield
- **Execute**: Creates a unit entity, updates battle data, and updates UI state
- **Undo**: Removes the unit entity, removes from battle data, and restores barracks count
- **Key Improvement**: Directly tracks the entity ID returned by `create_unit()` for reliable removal

#### RemoveUnitCommand
- **Purpose**: Handles removing units from the battlefield (right-click deletion)
- **Execute**: Removes unit entity and updates UI state
- **Undo**: Re-creates the unit at its original position with original properties

#### CompositeCommand
- **Purpose**: Executes multiple sub-commands as a single undoable operation
- **Execute**: Runs all sub-commands in order
- **Undo**: Undoes all sub-commands in reverse order
- **Key Feature**: Allows complex operations to be built from simple, tested commands

### Move Operation Implementation

Move operations are implemented using a **pending removal** approach that solves both the ghost unit problem and entity ID tracking issues:

#### The Problem with Previous Approaches
1. **Ghost Units**: Trying to track units without removing them left duplicate units on the battlefield
2. **Entity ID Invalidation**: When units are deleted and recreated, they get new entity IDs, making stored references invalid

#### The Solution: Immediate Removal + Pending State
1. **On Unit Pickup**: `RemoveUnitCommand` is executed immediately (unit disappears from battlefield)
2. **Pending State**: The removal command is stored in `pending_removal` but not added to undo stack yet
3. **On Placement**: `PlaceUnitCommand` is executed, then a `CompositeCommand` of both operations is added to undo stack
4. **On Cancellation**: The pending removal is undone directly (unit reappears at original position)

### State Management

#### Undo/Redo Stacks
The SetupBattleScene maintains two stacks:
- `undo_stack`: Stores executed commands that can be undone
- `redo_stack`: Stores undone commands that can be redone

#### Stack Behavior
- When a new command is executed, it's added to the undo stack and the redo stack is cleared
- When undoing, commands are moved from undo stack to redo stack
- When redoing, commands are moved from redo stack back to undo stack

#### Pending Removal Tracking
- `pending_removal`: Stores the `RemoveUnitCommand` when a unit is picked up for moving
- This command has been executed but not yet added to the undo stack
- Cleared when move completes, is cancelled, or when selecting from barracks

### User Interaction Flow

#### Moving a Unit
1. **Left-click on unit**: `RemoveUnitCommand` executes immediately (unit disappears)
2. **Unit type selected**: User sees preview of unit to place
3. **Left-click to place**: `PlaceUnitCommand` executes, `CompositeCommand` added to undo stack
4. **Right-click to cancel**: Pending removal is undone directly (unit reappears at original position)

#### Placing New Unit
1. **Click barracks unit**: Selects unit type for placement (cancels any pending move)
2. **Left-click to place**: Executes `PlaceUnitCommand` to create new unit

#### Removing Unit
1. **Right-click on unit**: Executes `RemoveUnitCommand` to delete unit

### Design Benefits

#### Solves Key Problems
- **No Ghost Units**: Units are immediately removed when picked up
- **No Entity ID Issues**: Commands don't rely on tracking entities across delete/recreate cycles
- **Clean State**: Battlefield always shows the actual current state

#### Composite Pattern Advantages
- **Reuse**: Move operations reuse existing, tested RemoveUnitCommand and PlaceUnitCommand logic
- **Consistency**: All operations use the same underlying mechanisms
- **Reliability**: No complex position update logic that could cause state inconsistencies
- **Maintainability**: Changes to remove/place logic automatically benefit move operations

#### Entity Management
- **Clean Lifecycle**: Units are properly removed and recreated rather than moved in place
- **State Consistency**: All entity components and battle data are managed consistently
- **No Entity Corruption**: Avoids potential issues with updating entity positions manually

### Integration Points

#### Modified Methods
1. **`create_unit_of_selected_type()`**: Now creates and executes a `PlaceUnitCommand`
2. **`remove_unit()`**: Now creates and executes a `RemoveUnitCommand`
3. **`update()`**: Completely rewritten mouse click logic with proper move handling
4. **`set_selected_unit_type()`**: Properly manages state when selection changes
5. **Barracks selection**: Cancels pending moves by undoing pending removals

#### Event Handling
The `handle_undo_redo_keys()` method:
- Detects Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Shift+Z key combinations
- Calls appropriate undo/redo methods
- Returns True if the event was handled to prevent further processing

## Data Integrity

### Complete State Restoration
Each command preserves and restores:
- **Unit Entity**: Complete unit with all components and properties
- **Battle Data**: Updates to `battle.allies` and `battle.enemies` lists
- **UI State**: Barracks unit counts and progress panel updates
- **Audio Feedback**: Appropriate sound effects for placement/removal/movement

### Coordinate System Handling
- Properly handles world coordinates vs. local battle coordinates
- Uses `axial_to_world()` for coordinate transformations
- Maintains consistency with existing placement logic

### Move Operation Benefits
- **Atomic**: Moving a unit is a single operation that can be undone with one Ctrl+Z
- **Safe**: Uses existing, tested remove/place logic rather than custom move code
- **Consistent**: Maintains the same entity lifecycle patterns as other operations
- **Robust**: No risk of entity state corruption from manual position updates
- **Visual**: Unit immediately disappears when picked up, eliminating confusion

## User Experience

### Seamless Integration
- Works with existing mouse placement/removal interactions
- Maintains all existing functionality (grid snapping, team restrictions, etc.)
- Provides immediate feedback through sound effects
- No visual changes to the UI - purely keyboard-driven

### Improved Move Handling
- **Before**: Moving a unit left ghost units and required complex entity tracking
- **After**: Units disappear immediately when picked up, move is single undoable operation
- **Cancellation**: Right-click during move restores unit to original position
- **State Management**: Selecting from barracks automatically cancels any pending move

### Edge Cases Handled
- Undo/redo when no actions are available (no-op)
- Proper clearing of redo stack when new actions are performed
- Maintains unit selection state appropriately
- Handles both sandbox and normal campaign modes
- Move cancellation doesn't pollute undo history
- Barracks selection clears move state by restoring picked-up units
- No duplicate units on battlefield during moves

## Code Quality

### Architecture Benefits
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new undoable operations and composite operations
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns with command classes
- **Testable**: Each command can be tested independently
- **Consistent**: Follows existing codebase patterns and style
- **Type Safe**: Proper typing for all state variables
- **Reusable**: CompositeCommand can be used for other multi-step operations
- **Debuggable**: Clear state tracking makes issues easy to identify

### Performance Considerations
- Minimal memory overhead (only stores command metadata)
- Efficient entity ID tracking eliminates search operations
- Move operations reuse existing optimized code paths
- Commands execute quickly without noticeable delay
- No entity duplication or ghost state management

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions that could be implemented using the same pattern:
- Undoable unit selection changes
- Undoable corruption power modifications
- Batch operations using CompositeCommand (e.g., "place multiple units", "clear all units")
- Undo history persistence across sessions
- Multi-step operations (pick up multiple units and move as a group)
- Macro commands (record and replay sequences of operations)
