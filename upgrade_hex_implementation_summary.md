# Upgrade Hex Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the upgrade hex system for BattleSwap, which allows players to unlock credits by claiming special purple hexes throughout the campaign.

## Requirements Fulfilled

### 1. ✅ Purple Upgrade Hexes
- **Location**: `src/world_map_view.py`
- **Implementation**: Added `HexType.UPGRADE` and `UpgradeFillState` enum
- **Rendering**: Upgrade hexes are rendered with solid purple color `(128, 0, 128)` for unclaimed, darker purple `(96, 0, 96)` for claimed
- **Edges**: Purple edges with width 3 to match battle hex styling

### 2. ✅ Campaign Editor Interface
- **Location**: `src/scenes/campaign_editor.py`
- **Features**:
  - Click empty hex → Shows "Create Battle" and "Create Upgrade Hex" buttons
  - Click upgrade hex → Shows "Delete Upgrade Hex" button
  - Counters showing total battles and upgrade hexes at top-left
  - Automatic counter updates when creating/deleting hexes

### 3. ✅ Claiming Mechanism
- **Location**: `src/scenes/campaign.py`
- **Features**:
  - Click available upgrade hex → Shows "Claim" button
  - Double-click or button click claims the hex
  - Plays heal.wav sound effect (temporary, can be changed later)
  - Awards 1 advanced_credit for normal claims
  - Awards 1 elite_credit for corrupted claims

### 4. ✅ Corruption Integration
- **Location**: `src/progress_manager.py`
- **Features**:
  - Upgrade hexes can be targeted by corruption
  - Corrupted upgrade hexes show red borders
  - Must claim corrupted upgrade hexes to continue progression
  - Claiming corrupted upgrade hex awards elite_credit instead of advanced_credit
  - Dark red border when corrupted hex is claimed

## Key Improvements Based on Feedback

### ✅ Claimed Upgrade Hexes in Solutions
- **Change**: Claimed upgrade hexes are now stored in the `solutions` dictionary
- **Benefits**: 
  - Consistent logic with battles - all completed content is in solutions
  - Simplified corruption and progression logic
  - Better integration with existing systems
- **Implementation**: Added `is_upgrade_hex` flag to `Solution` model to distinguish from battles

### ✅ Separate Fill States for Hex Types
- **Change**: Created separate enums for battle and upgrade hex visual states
- **Structure**:
  - `HexType` enum: BATTLE vs UPGRADE
  - `BattleFillState` enum: For battle hex states (NORMAL, HIGHLIGHTED, UNFOCUSED, FOGGED)
  - `UpgradeFillState` enum: For upgrade hex states (NORMAL, HIGHLIGHTED, UNFOCUSED, FOGGED, CLAIMED)
- **Benefits**: More granular control over visual states, easier to extend with new states

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Structure (`src/progress_manager.py`)
```python
class UpgradeHex(BaseModel):
    hex_coords: Tuple[int, int]
    # Note: No claimed flags - using solutions instead

class Solution(BaseModel):
    hex_coords: Tuple[int, int]
    unit_placements: List[Tuple[UnitType, Tuple[float, float]]]
    solved_corrupted: bool
    is_upgrade_hex: bool = False  # New field to distinguish upgrade hex solutions
```

### Visual System (`src/world_map_view.py`)
```python
class HexState:
    def __init__(self, 
                 hex_type: HexType, 
                 battle_fill: BattleFillState = BattleFillState.NORMAL,
                 upgrade_fill: UpgradeFillState = UpgradeFillState.NORMAL,
                 border: BorderState = BorderState.NORMAL):
        self.hex_type = hex_type
        self.battle_fill = battle_fill
        self.upgrade_fill = upgrade_fill
        self.border = border
```

### Key Methods Added/Modified
- `claim_upgrade_hex(hex_coords)` - Creates Solution with `is_upgrade_hex=True`
- `is_upgrade_hex_available(hex_coords)` - Checks solution state instead of claimed flags
- `available_battles()` - Simplified logic using solutions
- `corrupt_battles()` - Now includes all solved hexes (battles + upgrade hexes)

## Integration Points

### Available Battles System
- Upgrade hexes are included in `available_battles()` method using solution-based logic
- Adjacent unlocking works for upgrade hexes
- Corrupted upgrade hexes block progression until claimed

### Corruption System
- `corrupt_battles()` now targets all solved hexes equally
- `has_uncompleted_corrupted_battles()` checks solution corruption status
- Corruption panel handles mixed battle/upgrade hex corruption

### Visual System
- Separate fill states for battle vs upgrade hexes
- Purple base color with darker shade for claimed upgrade hexes
- Proper hover, selection, and corruption visual states
- Integration with existing border state system

## User Workflow

### Normal Flow
1. Player sees purple upgrade hex on campaign map
2. Click hex → "Claim" button appears
3. Click "Claim" or double-click hex
4. Sound plays, player receives 1 advanced_credit
5. Hex becomes darker purple (claimed state)
6. Hex is now stored in solutions as completed

### Corruption Flow
1. Player claims upgrade hex normally (gets advanced_credit, stored in solutions)
2. Corruption triggers, upgrade hex gets red border
3. Player must re-claim the corrupted hex
4. Claiming corrupted hex awards 1 elite_credit
5. Hex shows dark red border when corrupted claim is complete

### Campaign Editor Flow
1. Open campaign editor
2. Click empty hex → Choose "Create Upgrade Hex"
3. Purple hex appears, counter updates
4. Click upgrade hex → "Delete Upgrade Hex" option
5. Counters at top-left show current battle/upgrade hex counts

## Files Modified

1. **`src/progress_manager.py`** - Core data structures and logic, solutions integration
2. **`src/world_map_view.py`** - Rendering and visual integration, separate fill states
3. **`src/scenes/campaign_editor.py`** - Editor interface and counters
4. **`src/scenes/campaign.py`** - Claiming mechanics and sound effects

## Testing Recommendations

When testing the implementation:

1. **Editor Testing**:
   - Create upgrade hexes in various positions
   - Verify counters update correctly
   - Test deletion functionality

2. **Campaign Testing**:
   - Verify upgrade hexes appear purple (lighter when unclaimed, darker when claimed)
   - Test claiming mechanics (button + double-click)
   - Verify sound effects play
   - Check credit awards in progress panel
   - Verify claimed hexes persist in solutions

3. **Corruption Testing**:
   - Trigger corruption after claiming upgrade hexes
   - Verify corrupted upgrade hexes block progression
   - Test corrupted claiming awards elite credits
   - Verify visual states (red border → dark red border)

4. **Integration Testing**:
   - Verify upgrade hexes integrate with adjacent unlocking
   - Test save/load persistence (solutions-based)
   - Check upgrade hexes work with existing barracks UI
   - Verify grade calculations exclude upgrade hexes

## Notes

- Using temporary heal.wav sound effect for claiming (as requested)
- Upgrade hexes use same hex grid system as battles
- Implementation preserves all existing functionality
- Credit awards match unit tier upgrade system (advanced → elite progression)
- Solutions-based approach provides better consistency and maintainability
- Separate fill states allow for more sophisticated visual feedback
