# Upgrade Hex Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the upgrade hex system for BattleSwap, which allows players to unlock credits by claiming special purple hexes throughout the campaign.

## Requirements Fulfilled

### 1. ✅ Purple Upgrade Hexes
- **Location**: `src/world_map_view.py`
- **Implementation**: Added `FillState.UPGRADE_HEX` enum value
- **Rendering**: Upgrade hexes are rendered with solid purple color `(128, 0, 128)`
- **Edges**: Purple edges with width 3 to match battle hex styling

### 2. ✅ Campaign Editor Interface
- **Location**: `src/scenes/campaign_editor.py`
- **Features**:
  - Click empty hex → Shows "Create Battle" and "Create Upgrade Hex" buttons
  - Click upgrade hex → Shows "Delete Upgrade Hex" button
  - Counters showing total battles and upgrade hexes at top-left
  - Automatic counter updates when creating/deleting hexes

### 3. ✅ Claiming Mechanism
- **Location**: `src/scenes/campaign.py`
- **Features**:
  - Click available upgrade hex → Shows "Claim" button
  - Double-click or button click claims the hex
  - Plays heal.wav sound effect (temporary, can be changed later)
  - Awards 1 advanced_credit for normal claims
  - Awards 1 elite_credit for corrupted claims

### 4. ✅ Corruption Integration
- **Location**: `src/progress_manager.py`
- **Features**:
  - Upgrade hexes can be targeted by corruption
  - Corrupted upgrade hexes show red borders
  - Must claim corrupted upgrade hexes to continue progression
  - Claiming corrupted upgrade hex awards elite_credit instead of advanced_credit
  - Dark red border when corrupted hex is claimed

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Structure (`src/progress_manager.py`)
```python
class UpgradeHex(BaseModel):
    hex_coords: Tuple[int, int]
    claimed: bool = False
    claimed_corrupted: bool = False
```

### Key Methods Added
- `add_upgrade_hex(hex_coords)` - Creates upgrade hex
- `remove_upgrade_hex(hex_coords)` - Deletes upgrade hex
- `claim_upgrade_hex(hex_coords)` - Claims hex and awards credits
- `is_upgrade_hex_available(hex_coords)` - Checks if hex can be claimed

### Integration Points

#### Available Battles System
- Upgrade hexes are included in `available_battles()` method
- Adjacent unlocking works for upgrade hexes
- Corrupted upgrade hexes block progression until claimed

#### Corruption System
- `corrupt_battles()` now includes claimed upgrade hexes
- `has_uncompleted_corrupted_battles()` checks both battle and upgrade hex corruption
- Corruption panel handles mixed battle/upgrade hex corruption

#### Visual System
- Purple fill color for upgrade hexes
- Border states (normal, selected, corrupted, claimed corrupted)
- Proper hover and selection states
- Integration with existing hex state system

## User Workflow

### Normal Flow
1. Player sees purple upgrade hex on campaign map
2. Click hex → "Claim" button appears
3. Click "Claim" or double-click hex
4. Sound plays, player receives 1 advanced_credit
5. Hex becomes unavailable (no longer shows claim button)

### Corruption Flow
1. Player claims upgrade hex normally (gets advanced_credit)
2. Corruption triggers, upgrade hex gets red border
3. Player must re-claim the corrupted hex
4. Claiming corrupted hex awards 1 elite_credit
5. Hex shows dark red border when corrupted claim is complete

### Campaign Editor Flow
1. Open campaign editor
2. Click empty hex → Choose "Create Upgrade Hex"
3. Purple hex appears, counter updates
4. Click upgrade hex → "Delete Upgrade Hex" option
5. Counters at top-left show current battle/upgrade hex counts

## Files Modified

1. **`src/progress_manager.py`** - Core data structures and logic
2. **`src/world_map_view.py`** - Rendering and visual integration
3. **`src/scenes/campaign_editor.py`** - Editor interface and counters
4. **`src/scenes/campaign.py`** - Claiming mechanics and sound effects

## Testing Recommendations

When testing the implementation:

1. **Editor Testing**:
   - Create upgrade hexes in various positions
   - Verify counters update correctly
   - Test deletion functionality

2. **Campaign Testing**:
   - Verify upgrade hexes appear purple
   - Test claiming mechanics (button + double-click)
   - Verify sound effects play
   - Check credit awards in progress panel

3. **Corruption Testing**:
   - Trigger corruption after claiming upgrade hexes
   - Verify corrupted upgrade hexes block progression
   - Test corrupted claiming awards elite credits
   - Verify visual states (red border → dark red border)

4. **Integration Testing**:
   - Verify upgrade hexes integrate with adjacent unlocking
   - Test save/load persistence
   - Check upgrade hexes work with existing barracks UI

## Notes

- Using temporary heal.wav sound effect for claiming (as requested)
- Upgrade hexes use same hex grid system as battles
- Implementation preserves all existing functionality
- Credit awards match unit tier upgrade system (advanced → elite progression)
