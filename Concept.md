### **What is Battle Swap?**
**In Battle Swap, victory means more than defeating your enemies—it means trading armies. Take the enemy’s forces to tackle new challenges or perfect old ones, with each swap bringing you one step closer to leading an unstoppable army.**

### **Core Mechanics**
- **Army Swapping:** Winning a battle means trading your army for the enemy's. Over time, you'll upgrade your forces by defeating tougher foes.
- **Barracks System:** Units that aren't deployed in battle are stored in your **Barracks** and can be used for future challenges, giving you flexibility in your strategy.
- **Revisiting Battles:** Return to previously completed battles to optimize your strategies. You can use new, more powerful units or try to win with a simpler army, testing your tactical skills.
- **Node-Based Progression:** The game world is structured as a web of battles. You start at the center, and as you win battles, you unlock new nodes and challenges, progressing through increasingly complex encounters.

### **How Battles Play Out**
- **Auto-Chess Style Combat:** The enemy army is pre-deployed on their side of the arena. You position your units from the barracks on your side, and the battle resolves automatically.
- **Simple AI:** Units move toward the nearest enemy and attack once in range, so positioning and unit choice are key to outsmarting your foes.

### **Your Path to Victory**
- **Tactical Countering:** Success relies on using your army to counter the enemy’s forces. Even with a weaker army, smart positioning and unit selection can lead to victory.
- **Army Progression:** After each battle, your army grows stronger by inheriting the defeated enemy’s forces. This continuous cycle of upgrading allows you to face increasingly difficult challenges.
- **Revisiting Solutions:** There’s also a deep satisfaction in returning to past battles, optimizing your tactics, and using fewer resources or new units to achieve a more efficient victory.

### **Tutorial Example**
At the start of the game, you have 10 swordsmen. Your first three battles offer the chance to fight:
- 10 spearmen
- 10 archers
- 3 horsemen

The only battle you can win with your current army is against the archers, but it costs 7 swordsmen to do so. After the battle, you are left with 3 swordsmen and gain 10 archers. Now, you can face the spearmen, defeating them with 5 archers and keeping the remaining 3 swordsmen, 5 archers, and gaining 10 spearmen.

With your new forces, you can take on the horsemen, defeating them with 6 spearmen. Now, you have 3 swordsmen, 5 archers, 4 spearmen, and 3 horsemen. You can return to the archer battle and easily win with a single horseman, keeping the rest of your army intact. With this army, you are prepared to face the first boss, a mixed force that includes a powerful hero unit, which you defeat using the bulk of your army.

This tutorial introduces the core mechanics: winning battles, expanding your forces, revisiting earlier challenges, and using clever tactics to conserve units and grow your army.

### **Why Play Battle Swap?**
- **Puzzle-solving Fun:** Each battle is a puzzle, requiring careful thought and strategy to counter stronger armies with your available units.
- **Mastery of Mechanics:** Over time, you’ll refine your tactics, learning how to deploy your forces more effectively and make the most of your resources.
- **Iterative Strategy:** Revisiting battles with new units or optimized tactics is a key part of the experience. You’re constantly improving your solutions, using fewer units or better strategies to win more efficiently.
