# Unit Tier Upgrade System Implementation

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive unit tier upgrade system that allows players to upgrade their units from BASIC to ADVANCED to ELITE tiers using credits earned through gameplay.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Unit Tier Upgrade UI (`src/ui_components/unit_tier_upgrade_ui.py`)

**Main Features:**
- **Large popup window** (1000x700) accessible from the campaign scene
- **Scrollable unit selection** at the top showing all unlocked units
- **Three-tier card display** showing Basic, Advanced, and Elite versions side by side
- **Visual tier indicators** with color-coded borders:
  - Basic: Standard border
  - Advanced: Purple border (`#8A2BE2`)
  - Elite: Orange border (`#FF8C00`)
- **Credit display** showing current Advanced Credits and Elite Credits
- **Upgrade functionality** with cost display and upgrade buttons

**Components:**
- `UnitTierUpgradeUI`: Main window manager
- `UnitCardPanel`: Panel-based unit card for tier comparison

### 2. Campaign Scene Integration (`src/scenes/campaign.py`)

**Added:**
- **"Unit Upgrades" button** positioned at top-left (10, 10)
- **Event handling** for opening/closing the upgrade UI
- **Import integration** with the new upgrade system

### 3. Visual Styling (`data/theme.json`)

**New Theme Classes:**
- `@unit_tier_basic`: Standard unit border styling
- `@unit_tier_advanced`: Purple border styling for Advanced units
- `@unit_tier_elite`: Orange border styling for Elite units
- `@unit_card_basic/advanced/elite`: Rounded panel borders for unit cards
- `@current_tier_text`: Green text for current tier indicators
- `@locked_tier_text`: Red text for locked tiers
- `@available_tier_text`: Yellow text for available tiers

### 4. Enhanced Unit Data System (`src/ui_components/game_data.py`)

**Improvements:**
- **Tier-aware stat calculation** for all unit types
- **Damage scaling** (1.5x for Advanced, 2.0x for Elite)
- **Modification tracking** to show which stats have been upgraded
- **Backward compatibility** with existing unit card system

### 5. Progress Manager Integration

**Already Existing (Used):**
- `advanced_credits: int = 10` - Currency for Basic → Advanced upgrades
- `elite_credits: int = 10` - Currency for Advanced → Elite upgrades
- `unit_tiers: Dict[UnitType, UnitTier]` - Current tier for each unit
- `get_unit_tier()`, `can_upgrade_unit()`, `upgrade_unit()` methods

## How It Works

### Opening the Upgrade UI
1. Player clicks "Unit Upgrades" button in campaign scene
2. UI window opens showing all unlocked units in scrollable list
3. Units display with tier-colored borders based on current tier

### Selecting and Upgrading Units
1. Click any unit in the top list
2. Three panels appear showing Basic, Advanced, and Elite versions
3. Each panel shows:
   - Unit name with tier designation
   - Point cost
   - Description
   - Simplified stats summary
   - Current tier indicator (CURRENT/LOCKED/AVAILABLE)
   - Upgrade button (if applicable)
4. Click upgrade button to spend credits and upgrade unit

### Visual Feedback
- **Border colors** immediately update when units are upgraded
- **Credit counters** update in real-time
- **Tier indicators** show progression clearly
- **Upgrade buttons** only appear for next available tier

## Technical Architecture

### Unit Card System
- Maintained existing `UnitCard` class for windows
- Created new `UnitCardPanel` class for embedded panel use
- Both share similar content structure but different containers

### Event Handling
- UI handles all internal events (button clicks, unit selection)
- Returns `True` when closed to notify parent scene
- Clean resource management with proper `kill()` methods

### Data Flow
1. Progress manager stores current tiers and credits
2. Game data system applies tier modifiers to stats
3. UI displays current state and handles upgrades
4. Changes persist through progress manager save system

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems Used
- **Progress Manager**: For tier storage and credit management
- **Unit Data System**: For stat calculation and display
- **Theme System**: For visual styling and borders
- **Battle System**: For unlocked unit detection

### New Systems Added
- **Tier Upgrade UI**: Complete interface for managing upgrades
- **Panel-based Unit Cards**: For embedded display
- **Tier Visual Indicators**: Color-coded progression system

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Tier-specific abilities**: Different abilities per tier
2. **More stat scaling**: Health, speed, range upgrades
3. **Visual unit upgrades**: Different sprites per tier
4. **Achievement integration**: Tier-based unlocks
5. **Balance tuning**: Adjustable tier multipliers

## Usage

The system is now fully integrated and ready to use. Players can:
1. Start the game with 10 Advanced Credits and 10 Elite Credits
2. Open the Unit Upgrades from the campaign scene
3. Select any unlocked unit to view tier progression
4. Upgrade units using credits (1 credit per upgrade)
5. See immediate visual feedback with tier borders
6. Use upgraded units in battles with improved stats

The system maintains full backward compatibility and integrates seamlessly with existing save/load functionality.
